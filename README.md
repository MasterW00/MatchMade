# Overview

I wanted to learn rust and undstand the tools it has that set it apart from other languages. I decided to make a simple program where I can learn variable and memory managment as well as a lot of case and error handeling with propogation.

This program give a user an easy freindly experiance to check their compatibility with another person based on their astological attributes. A user launched the match guide program and enters in the information in an intuitive way. Then the computer calculates and presents the compatibility that the people entered share.

I wanted to get used to the variable ownership and error handeling aspects of rust as those where some of the big differences that are not structured like other languages. I wanted to learn rust for its ecosystem and figure out how i could program somethign in a rust way that i couldn't so in another language.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and a number of Rust tutorials

I used Rust and the standard rust libraries
# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

- [Rust OpenGL](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/learn-opengl/basics/index.html)
- [Learn Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
# Future Work

- Add at scale compatiblility testing to find best matches in a list of people
- Learn to use OpenGL Rust crates and make animations and other graphics for this program
- fun interactible adventure to increace compatibility between you and your crush written with my one engine for openGL in rust or maybe Vulkan if im going crazy
